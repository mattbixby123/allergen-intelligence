# Allergen Intelligence Platform

> Solving the chemical translation problem in allergen identification using RAG and vector search

**Status:** üöß Active Development - Phase 1 (Foundation)

## The Problem

Product ingredient labels list common chemical names like "Limonene" - but the actual allergen is often **"Limonene hydroperoxide"** (an oxidation product formed when the ingredient degrades). Consumers unknowingly search for side effects of the wrong compound, missing critical safety information about what's actually causing their reactions.

**No existing tools make this chemical translation automatically.**

## My Solution

A RAG-powered platform that bridges the gap between ingredient labels and actual allergen information:

- **Chemical Translation**: Uses PubChem API to identify correct chemical structures and CAS numbers
- **Oxidation Product Mapping**: Automatically identifies allergenic breakdown products (e.g., limonene ‚Üí limonene hydroperoxide)
- **Clinical Research Synthesis**: Leverages OpenAI web search to find and synthesize peer-reviewed allergen data
- **Intelligent Retrieval**: Stores findings in pgvector for semantic search and context-aware responses
- **Source Verification**: Every claim includes URL attribution to original research

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Spring Boot 3.x, Java 21
- **AI/ML**: Spring AI, OpenAI GPT-4, text-embedding-3-small
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 17 + pgvector extension
- **APIs**: PubChem REST API, OpenAI API
- **Future**: React/Next.js frontend, Tesseract OCR

### Key Innovation: Automated Chemical Translation

**Traditional Approach**: User must manually know that limonene oxidizes to allergenic peroxides

**This System**:
1. User inputs "Limonene"
2. System identifies it oxidizes to "Limonene hydroperoxide"
3. Searches for side effects of BOTH compounds
4. Returns comprehensive, properly attributed allergen information

This leverages my chemistry background to solve a real-world problem that affects millions of consumers.

## API Preview

```bash
# Analyze product ingredients
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/allergens/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "productName": "Citrus Body Lotion",
    "ingredients": ["Limonene", "Linalool", "Citral"]
  }'

# Response includes:
# - Chemical identifications with CAS numbers
# - Oxidation products
# - Side effects with severity ratings
# - Source URLs for verification
# - Overall risk assessment
```

## Why This Project Matters

As someone with a background in chemistry, I recognized a critical gap: **ingredient labels don't reflect the actual chemicals that cause allergic reactions.** This platform bridges that knowledge gap using:

- Domain expertise (organic chemistry, allergen science)
- Modern AI techniques (RAG, embeddings, LLMs)
- Production-grade architecture (vector databases, REST APIs)

### What This Demonstrates

- **Full-stack development**: Backend APIs, future React frontend
- **AI/ML integration**: RAG pipelines, vector search, prompt engineering
- **Complex domain modeling**: Chemistry + healthcare data structures
- **API design**: RESTful services, OpenAPI documentation
- **Database expertise**: PostgreSQL, vector similarity search
- **Real-world problem solving**: Translating domain expertise into software

## Contributing

This is primarily a portfolio project, but I welcome:
