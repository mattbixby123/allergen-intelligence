# Allergen Intelligence Platform - Development Roadmap

## Project Vision

Build a production-ready RAG-powered application that translates consumer product ingredients into scientifically accurate allergen information with full source verification. The platform bridges the critical gap between ingredient labels and actual allergenic compounds.

## Core Innovation

### The Chemical Translation Problem
- **What consumers see**: "Limonene" on ingredient labels
- **What actually causes reactions**: "Limonene hydroperoxide" (oxidation product)
- **Current reality**: Consumers search for wrong compound, miss critical safety info
- **Our solution**: Automated chemical translation with AI-powered research synthesis

## Architecture Overview
